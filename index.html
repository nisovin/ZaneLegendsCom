		<p>
			Zane Legends is a fictional character created as a writing exercise. The basic idea is to choose
			a random genre, setting, and secondary character; then write a short story about Zane Legends, using
			those criteria, in under an hour.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The purpose of this writing exercise is to get you to write a short story, and finish it.
			The criteria may seem limiting at first, but they are actually there to increase your 
			creativity. The idea is to get you to try new things that may be outside of your usual
			writing comfort zone.

		<h2 id="rulesForWriting">Rules for Writing</h2>
		
		<p>
			If you want to write a Zane Legends story, you should try to follow the rules below.
			These rules are to give direction and help increase your creativity. Try not to think
			of the rules as limitations, instead think of them as a way to help you write a story.
		</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>You must use the same opening for each Zane story.</strong><br>
				<em>Some people have a knack for finding strange things. Strange things always seem
				to find Zane Legends.</em><br>
				You should always start with this opening, and you should even type it out, don't copy
				and paste! This allows you to get your fingers on the keyboard and start writing. Once
				you finish this opening, don't stop! Let the story flow.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>You must keep the criteria you are given.</strong><br>
				Don't reroll to get criteria that you like better! Part of this exercise is to break out of 
				your preferred writing style and try something new.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>You must incorporate the criteria into the story.</strong><br>
				You don't have to necessarily make the criteria the central part of your story, but they
				should be important in some way. You are not allowed to leave one out just because you don't 
				like it. Again, this is about stretching your limits. See the information about the
				criteria below.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Do not write for more than 60 minutes.</strong><br>
				You may be tempted to write for longer than that, but don't do it! Part of this exercise
				is to start and finish a story within a time period. You may discover that your story has
				started down a path that makes it hard to finish, but finish it anyway! You might be 
				surprised how difficult this can be.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Limit yourself to 1500 words.</strong><br>
				As with the time limit, this is to encourage you to write and finish a complete story.
				Don't allow yourself to go over, this is part of the challenge!
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Include some of Zane's character traits.</strong><br>
				This rule isn't as important, but it helps keep all of the adventures of Zane Legends feeling
				like they describe the same character. See the list below.
			</li>
		</ol>
		
		<hr>
		
		<h2 id="storyCriteria">Story Criteria</h2>
		
		<h4>Genre</h4>	
		<p>
			Genres are things like Fantasy, Mystery, or Romance. The genre will determine the general theme
			of the story you write. Some genres may overlap, for example, it's certainly possible to have
			a romantic fantasy. This website will only give you one genre, so you can of course choose
			another to go along if needed.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Setting</h4>
		<p>
			Examples of settings are "on a beach", "at night", and "underground". These generally serve as
			a location or situation for your story. You aren't required to use the setting for the entire
			story, and you can have Zane go to other places. However, the chosen setting should be an
			important part of the story.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Character</h4>
		<p>
			A secondary character could be a doctor, a political figure, or a thief. This is a character
			that should feature prominently in the story. This character should be included, but you are not 
			limited to just this one character. Just remember that you only have a limited amount of time
			and words, so don't introduce too many characters or you won't finish the story!
		</p>
		
		<hr>
		
		<h2 id="traitsOfZane">Traits of Zane Legends</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Zane is afraid of stairs.</strong><br>
				This is not a simple fear, this is a debilitating phobia. Zane is absolutely terrified
				of stairs of all kinds, and will avoid them at all costs.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Zane loves to eat.</strong><br>
				It doesn't matter what, Zane loves food of all kinds.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>There is a scar on Zane's forehead.</strong><br>
				The scar is very visible, and is roughly shaped like a "Y". The origin story of this scar
				is fascinating and exciting, but Zane never seems to get a chance to tell it.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Zane's preferred exclamation is "Sausages!"</strong><br>
				Sometimes adjectives or other words are added (for example, "smoked sausages!"). Zane uses it when excited, angry, 
				and disappointed. Whatever the situation,
				if an exclamation is required, it's almost always "Sausages!"
			</li>
		</ul>
